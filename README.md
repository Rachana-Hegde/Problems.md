# 🧠 Python Assignment Problems – Console-Based Solutions

This repository contains console-based Python programs that solve four foundational algorithmic problems: **Caesar Cipher**, **Indian Currency Formatter**, **Combining Two Lists with Position Logic**, and **Minimizing Financial Loss**. All solutions are input-driven and follow a clean, modular approach suitable for interviews, assignments, or practice.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔐 **Caesar Cipher** for encoding and decoding secret messages.
* 💰 **Indian Currency Formatter** to format float numbers as per Indian comma rules (e.g., 12,34,567.89).
* 🔄 **Combine Overlapping Position-Based Lists** with intelligent merge logic.
* 📉 **Minimize Financial Loss** by selecting the optimal year to buy/sell under loss-only conditions.

Each program:

* Accepts user input via terminal.
* Gives meaningful output.
* Contains built-in validation and edge-case handling.

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Environment:** Command-line (CLI)
* **No third-party libraries required** (Only built-in modules like `ast` are used)

## 🧠 Problem Descriptions & Logic

### 🔐 1. Caesar Cipher

Encodes or decodes messages by shifting alphabet characters left or right by a given amount.

**User Input:**

* Message to encode/decode
* Shift amount
* Mode (`encode` or `decode`)

### 💰 2. Indian Currency Format

Takes a float number and prints it in Indian number system format (e.g., 1,23,456.7891).

**User Input:**

* A float number like `123456.7891`

### 🔄 3. Combining Two Lists (Based on Position)

Given two lists with elements having `[left, right]` positions and `values`, combines them if **more than half of one overlaps with another**, keeping the earlier position.

**User Input:**

* Two lists (via copy-paste into terminal in Python list format)

### 📉 4. Minimizing Financial Loss

Given a list of house prices over years, determines the best year to **buy high and sell low** while minimizing the total loss.

**User Input:**

* Space-separated prices (e.g., `20 15 7 2 13`)

## 📥 Installation & Running

### ✅ Clone & Navigate

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-assignment-problems.git
cd python-assignment-problems
```

### ✅ Run Each Program Individually

```bash
python Caesar Cipher encoding and decoding.py
